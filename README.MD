A few fun experiments with the BBC micro:bit.

# IRL Status
Essential for WFH.  A pair of micro:bits in adjacent rooms can signal via Bluetooth.  One button broadcasts an image to represent status (DND, Ready for A Break, etc) while the other button prompts an update.

# Chaos Candle
Using Logistic Map to produce a flickering behaviour in LEDs with a wick that burns down.
